# Working-with-timestamps

This is an example of how you can process and count timestamps as daily indicators of adherence to just about anything.  The code here specifically processes timestamps from an electronic pill bottle. The original data files are excel. Python code was used to create start and end dates from the original datasets. The second part of the code is written in SAS and contains the adherence scores (see also text file).
