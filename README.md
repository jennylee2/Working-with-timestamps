# Working-with-timestamps

This is an example of how you can process and count timestamps as daily indicators of adherence to just about anything.  This code specifically aims to process timestamps from an electronic pill bottle. The data output files are excel. Original python code was used to create start and end dates from the original datasets. The second part of the code is written in SAS and contains the actual adherence scores (100% being perfect adherenece).
